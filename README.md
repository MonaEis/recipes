Built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Supabase**, it allows users to explore and manage recipes with a sleek, responsive UI. This project is part of my learning journey and reflects my growing skills in modern web development.

## Design

The design and name of **L√∂ffelgr√ºn** were fully created by me.  
My goal was to craft a clean, modern, and user-friendly recipe platform with a fresh identity.

All styling and layout were built using **custom CSS only** ‚Äì no component libraries were used. This allowed me to deepen my understanding of fundamental styling and maintain full creative control over the visual appearance.

‚ö†Ô∏è The app is **still a work in progress** ‚Äì responsive layout for all screen sizes is currently being implemented.

<!-- ### Responsive Example Screenshots:
